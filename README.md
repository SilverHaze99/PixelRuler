# PixelRuler - OSINT Image Measurement Tool

**PixelRuler** is a specialized computer vision tool designed for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) analysts to perform precise measurements on digital images. The tool enables analysts to measure objects in images using known reference objects or collect pixel-based measurements for later scaling.

## Purpose

PixelRuler solves a common OSINT challenge: determining the real-world size of objects in images. By using reference objects of known dimensions, analysts can:

- Measure unknown objects using known references (phones, credit cards, coins, etc.)
- Build measurement chains across multiple images
- Document findings with precise measurements and timestamps
- Export data for further analysis

## Key Features

- **Interactive Measurement**: Point-and-click interface for drawing measurement lines
- **Reference Object Database**: Pre-loaded common objects with real-world dimensions
- **Optional Scaling**: Save pixel-only measurements when no reference is available
- **Zoom & Pan**: Detailed examination of high-resolution images (up to 10x zoom)
- **Data Persistence**: Automatic saving/loading of measurements per image
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV export for integration with analysis workflows
- **Chain of Custody**: Timestamped measurements for documentation

## Installation

### Requirements

## ðŸ”— OSINT Measurement Chains

PixelRuler enables analysts to build measurement chains across multiple images:

### Scenario Example:
1. **Image 1**: Contains iPhone (known) + Unknown Object X
   - Measure iPhone: 150px = 147.5mm
   - Measure Object X: 200px = 196.7mm
   - Scale factor: 0.983 mm/px

2. **Image 2**: Contains Object X (now known) + Unknown Object Y  
   - Enter Object X as custom reference: 196.7mm
   - Measure Object Y using Object X as reference

3. **Image 3**: Use Object Y as new reference for Object Z

## Visual Features
